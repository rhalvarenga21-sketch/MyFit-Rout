# 🧠 MYFITROUT: PRODUCT STRATEGY & MARKET FIT

## 1. THE CORE PROBLEM (Why we exist)
**The "Intermediate Plateau"**
*   **Beginners** see results doing anything.
*   **Intermediates** get stuck. They go to the gym, lift the same weights for months, and stop changing. They need structured progression (Periodization) but:
    1.  **Personal Trainers are expensive** ($/€ 200-500/mo).
    2.  **Tracker Apps** are just dumb notebooks; they don't guide you.
    3.  **YouTube Videos** are passive; they don't track *your* weights.

✅ **MyFitRout Solution:**
An **Automated Active Coach**. We bridge the gap between a dumb notebook and a human coach. We tell you the weight, the reps, and when to progress.

## 2. MARKET VALIDATION (Global Scale)
**Is this viable globally?**
*   **YES.** Fitness is a Universal Language. A bench press is a bench press in Brazil, Ireland, or Japan.
*   **Target Audience:** "The Committed Improver".
    *   Age: 20-45.
    *   Status: Has a gym membership but no trainer.
    *   Pain Point: Wants to look better/get stronger but feels "lost" on the gym floor.

**Key Markets:**
1.  **Brazil:** Huge fitness culture, high volume of users, price sensitive (Volume play).
2.  **Europe/Ireland:** High willingness to pay, focused on efficiency/time-saving.
3.  **USA:** Highly competitive, requires specific niche marketing (e.g., "Powerbuilding for Dads").

## 3. BUSINESS MODEL & SALES
**Freemium Product-Led Growth (PLG)**

*   **Free Tier:**
    *   Access to basic tracking.
    *   Standard library.
    *   *Goal:* Get them hooked on the habit.
*   **PRO Tier ($/€ 9.99/mo):**
    *   AI Personal Coach (Vital).
    *   Progress Analytics (Charts).
    *   Unlimited Routines.
    *   Nutrition Tracking.
    *   *Value:* Cheaper than 1 session with a human trainer.

**Growth Strategy (Zero-Cost Marketing):**
1.  **Viral Loop:** The "Instagram Share Card" (implemented). Every shared workout is a billboard.
2.  **Content:** Blog/TikToks relating to "How to break plateaus" (linking to the app).
3.  **Referral:** "Give 1 month Pro, Get 1 month Pro".

## 4. KEY METRICS (KPIs)
Don't measure "Downloads" (Vanity metric). Measure:

1.  **Workout Completion Rate:** Are users actually finishing the sessions?
2.  **Day-30 Retention:** What % of users are still active after 1 month?
3.  **Upgrade Conversion:** Free -> Pro rate (Benchmark: 2-4%).

1.  **Solid Tracking:** (Done - ActiveWorkout)
2.  **Visual Progress:** (Done - Dashboard)
